    <p>Well, the days are passing really badly.<br>
    I keep thinking that maybe the problem is me.<br> Surely, a big part of it is because of me.<br>
    I'm not supposed to have a future.<br> I'm destined to die with this feeling of dissatisfaction</p>

<div class="cnum2">
    <P>Yesterday, I finished the course where I was learning HTML. If my mental state and a lot of other things had been better, I should have finished it earlier. In the middle of learning, I also started learning CSS. Anyway, once I finish these two, Iâ€™ll move on to JavaScript</P>
